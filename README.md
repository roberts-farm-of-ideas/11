## This idea in short

In the publication "Spectral Unmixing-Based Reaction Monitoring of Transformations between Nucleosides and Nucleobases" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000204) it says:

> Fluorinated purine nucleosides 22 and 23 were found to be quite sensitive to alkaline conditions as these nucleosides underwent a temperature- and base-promoted side reaction (Figure S2), presumably by 5’−OH attack at the purine ring.

The compounds under discussion are: 2-fluoroadenosine (22) and 2’-deoxy-2-fluoroadenosine (23). 

While this speculation is probably true, it would be interesting to 1) find out whether this hypothesis was confirmed by previous researchers, and 2) to isolate the decomposition product to prove this hypothesis. 


## Sounds great, but...
You are interested in this topic? But the idea is gibberish and incomplete, or non-sense? Well, you're probably right! 

All of this is work in progress -- I would be very happy if you get in touch so we can improve this!

## How to Use
You are free to use this idea in whatever way you like. I put this material under CC-BY license, just to make it legally clear, but: "Gedanken sind frei" (ideas are free) -- I don't expect them to be protectable anyway.

## About this Farm of Ideas
[This "Farm of Ideas"](https://github.com/roberts-farm-of-ideas) is supposed to store ideas I would like to develop into scientific progress some day, and to store their progression from initial idea being had, over keeping them alive, to growing them into something real and then "harvesting". 

If you are faster in developing them, I am happy with you and for the world! :) Just to avoid me having spend time on something you already realized then, I would be grateful for a short letting-me-know email.
